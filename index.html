      <p class="bio">My name is Michael but most people call me Garland. I was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas and I still live with an
        old friend from my hometown. I moved to Atlanta in 2013 and lived in a storage closet for 8 months before getting
        a bedroom and bed of my own.</p>
      <p class="bio">After graduating college in 2011 with two degrees, one in Political Science and the other in Writing, I spent two years
        teaching and writing in Thailand. I traveled all over the country and spent time with over 100 elephants. I also
        ate my favorite food, kao soi, for lunch every day.</p>
      <p class="bio">These days I love running, improv comedy, and learning to code.</p>
      <p class="bio">I have performed with numerous improv troupes and on even more stages as a comedian. I've met some of the best friends
        I've ever had through comedy and wouldn't change a thing. Unfortunately, I am taking a break in order to study computer
        development. But as I said before, "I wouldn't change a thing."</p>
