    <p class="bio">My name is Michael but most people call me, Garland. I was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas and I still live with an old
      friend from my hometown. I love running, improv comedy, and learning to code.</p>
    <p class="bio">I have performed with numerous improv troupes and on even more stages as a comedian. I've met some of the best friends
      I've ever had and wouldn't change a thing. Unfortunately, I am taking a break in order to study computer development.
      But as I said before, "I wouldn't change a thing."</p>
